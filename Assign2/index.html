<h5>[Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian, Francisco]</h5>

<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>GONZALO</h3>
        <h4>[To ALONSO]</h4>
        <p>1      By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;</p>
        <p>       My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed</p>
        <p>3      Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,</p>
        <p>       I needs must rest me.</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <h3>ALONSO</h3>
        <p>       Old lord, I cannot blame thee,</p>
        <p>5      Who am myself attach'd with weariness,</p>
        <p>6      To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.</p>
        <p>7      Even here I will put off my hope and keep it</p>
        <p>8      No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd</p>
        <p>       No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd</p>
        <p>10     Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <h3>ANTONIO</h3>
        <h4>[Aside to SEBASTIAN]</h4>
        <p>       I am right glad that he's so out of hope.</p>
        <p>12     Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose</p>
        <p>       That you resolved to effect.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>SEBASTIAN</h3>
        <h4>[Aside to ANTONIO]</h4>
        <p>       The next advantage Will we take throughly.</p>

    </li>
        <li>
        <h3>ANTONIO</h3>
        <h4>[Aside to SEBASTIAN]</h4>
        <p>       Let it be to-night;</p>
        <p>15     For, now they are oppress'd with travail, they</p>
        <p>       Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance</p>
        <p>       As when they are fresh.</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <h3>SEBASTIAN</h3>
        <h4>[Aside to ANTONIO]</h4>
        <p>       I say, to-night: no more.</p>
        <p>       Solemn and strange music</p>

    </li>
        <li>
        <h3>ALONSO</h3>
        <p>       What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <h3>GONZALO</h3>
        <p>       Marvellous sweet music!</p>
    </li>
        <li>
            <h5>[Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet;
they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation; and, inviting the King and company
to eat, they depart]</h5>
    </li>
        <li>
        <h3>ALONSO</h3>
        <p>20     Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <h3>SEBASTIAN</h3>
        <p>21     A living drollery. Now I will believe</p>
        <p>       That there are unicorns, that in Arabia</p>
        <p>       There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix</p>
        <p>       At this hour reigning there.</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <h3>ANTONIO</h3>
        <p>       I'll believe both;</p>
        <p>25     And what does else want credit, come to me,</p>
        <p>26     And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did</p>
        <p>       lie,</p>
        <p>       Though fools at home condemn 'em.</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <h3>GONZALO</h3>
        <p>       If in Naples</p>
        <p>       I should report this now, would they believe me?</p>
        <p>       If I should say, I saw such islanders--</p>
        <p>30     For, certes, these are people of the island--</p>
        <p>       Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,</p>
        <p>32     Their manners are more gentle-kind than of</p>
        <p>       Our human generation you shall find</p>
        <p>       Many, nay, almost any.</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <h3>   PROSPERO</h3>
        <p>       [Aside] Honest lord,</p>
        <p>       Thou hast said well; for some of you there present</p>
        <p>       Are worse than devils.</p>
        <p></p>
    </li>
