<h1>Characters from the Tempest</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
       <h3>Prospero</h3>
       <p>The play's protagonist and Miranda's father. Usurped and exiled by his brother Antonio, the duke of Milan.</p>
   </li>

       <h3>Miranda</h3>
       <p>Prospero's daughter, whom he brought with him to the island when she was still a small child. Miranda has

       <h3>Ariel</h3>
       <p>Prospero's spirit helper, a powerful supernatural being whom Prospero controls completely. Rescued by
           Prospero from a long imprisonment (within a tree) at the hands of the witch Sycorax.</p>
   </li>
        <li>
       <h3>Caliban</h3>
       <p>Another of Prospero's servants. Caliban, the son of the now-deceased witch Sycorax, acquainted Prospero with

   </li>
       <li>
       <h3>Ferdinand</h3>
       <p>Son and heir of Alonso, the King of Naples. He falls in love with Miranda and happily submits to servitude in
